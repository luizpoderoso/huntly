# Huntly

A full-stack job application tracker built to demonstrate production-grade software engineering practices — Clean
Architecture, CQRS, Domain-Driven Design patterns, and a modern reactive frontend.

## What it does

Huntly lets you track job applications through their lifecycle — from initial application to offer or rejection. Each
application can have interviews and notes attached to it, and the status updates in real time.

## Architecture

Huntly follows Clean Architecture with four layers. The critical invariant is that `Core` has zero dependencies on any
other layer — the domain never knows about the database, HTTP, or any framework.

```
┌──────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌──────┐
│   Api    │────▶│ Application │────▶│ Core │
└────┬─────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────┘
     │                  ▲                 ▲
     │           ┌──────┴───┐            │
     └──────────▶│  Infra   │────────────┘
                 └──────────┘
```

`Api` references `Infra` only at the composition root — `Program.cs` calls `AddInfrastructure()` to wire up DI. Nothing
else in `Api` (endpoints, middleware) ever touches `Infra` directly. Endpoints only talk to `Application` via MediatR.

`Infra` depends on both `Application` and `Core`, but for different reasons:

- **`Infra → Core`** — implements `IJobApplicationRepository` (defined in `Core`) and references domain entities
  directly in EF Core configurations. Repository interfaces live in `Core` because the domain defines what persistence
  it needs — infrastructure provides it.
- **`Infra → Application`** — implements `ITokenService`, `IAtomicWork`, and `IUserContext` (defined in `Application`).
  These are orchestration abstractions, not domain concerns — the domain has no concept of JWT tokens or units of work.

What matters is that the arrow never reverses: `Core` knows nothing about EF Core, PostgreSQL, or any infrastructure
concern.

### Key design decisions

**Value Objects over primitive types**
`CompanyName`, `Position`, `JobUrl`, and `SalaryRange` are Value Objects, not strings and decimals. Rules are enforced
at construction — if the object exists, it is valid. No scattered null checks or format validation across the codebase.

**CQRS with MediatR pipeline behaviors**
Every use case is a `Command` or `Query` with a dedicated `Handler`. Cross-cutting concerns — validation, logging,
performance monitoring — run as pipeline behaviors registered once, applied to every request automatically.

**Argon2id password hashing**
Identity's default PBKDF2 is vulnerable to GPU-accelerated attacks. Argon2id is memory-hard by design, making brute
force attacks impractical even with modern hardware. Password validation rules live in `RegisterCommandValidator`, not
in Identity — a single source of truth.

**Aggregate boundary enforcement**
**Aggregate boundary enforcement**
`Interview` and `Note` are child entities of `JobApplication`. They have no navigation property back to the parent and
are only reachable through the aggregate root. `JobApplicationId` is an explicit property on both child entities —
required for EF Core to correctly track new entities added to private collections on already-tracked aggregates.

**Separation of mutation errors from fetch state**
In the frontend jobs store, failed mutations (create, update, delete) surface as toast notifications only. They never
overwrite the `error` state used by the UI — a failed form submission never hides your job list.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 10 SDK
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm
- PostgreSQL (or Docker)

### Backend

**1. Clone and navigate to backend**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/huntly.git
cd huntly/backend
```

**2. Set up User Secrets**

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:Default" "Host=localhost;Database=huntly;Username=postgres;Password=your-password" -p src/Huntly.Api
dotnet user-secrets set "Jwt:Secret" "your-secret-min-32-characters-long" -p src/Huntly.Api
dotnet user-secrets set "Auth:Pepper" "your-pepper-value" -p src/Huntly.Api
```

**3. Database Setup**

The application is configured to apply migrations automatically on startup. Ensure your PostgreSQL instance is running
and the connection string in User Secrets is correct.

_Note: If you prefer manual control during development, you can still run:_
`dotnet ef database update --project src/Huntly.Infra --startup-project src/Huntly.Api`

**4. Start the API**

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Huntly.Api
```

The API runs on `http://localhost:5163`.

### Frontend

**1. Navigate to frontend**

```bash
cd huntly/frontend
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
pnpm install
```

**3. Set up environment**

```bash
echo "PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5163/api" > .env
```

**4. Start the dev server**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`.

## API overview

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`. An interactive API reference is available at `/scalar/v1`.

## Deployment

The project is architected for a decoupled deployment:

- **Frontend:** Hosted on **Netlify**, utilizing the SvelteKit Netlify Adapter for SSR and edge functions.
- **Backend:** Hosted on **Render**, running as a persistent web service.
- **Database:** **Serverless PostgreSQL** provided by **Neon**, ensuring low-latency and auto-scaling capabilities.

### CI/CD Flow

1. Pushing to `main` triggers a build on both platforms.
2. The Backend runs automated migrations via `context.Database.Migrate()` during the startup sequence to ensure the
   schema is always in sync with the latest domain models.
3. The Frontend communicates with the Backend via a secure CORS-enabled API.
